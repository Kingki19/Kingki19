| Interests | Data, technology, AI, science, hydroponics, generative-AI, Coffee, SDG |
| Hobbies | Living life | 
| Motto | "*Memento Mori*" |

> Most of my apps, i use Python and Streamlit framework because it's easy (i can express and built my app idea alone) and free deployment (in streamlit community cloud). I never code locally, that is reason you will see lot of commits in my reposities.

> Damn, i tried to join some organization in my campus but there's nothing that focus on AI development. Actually, there's research organization, but my attitude is fucked up while interview and i didn't get accepted. I put all of my best works here, some alone and some is best works with my friends.
