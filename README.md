  <summary> ðŸ¤” Reason me being myself and doing what I do: </summary>
    <p>When I was a teenager, I delved into several fields of study on my own, like philosophy, strategy, mathematics, history, and the formation of knowledge. I was fascinated by how technology evolved over time, from a mere flame used to melt copper to us creating splashes of artificial intelligence resembling humans.

I deeply admire figures from the past, such as Aristotle, who was the first to develop the scientific method; Leonardo DaVinci, with his unique and eccentric works; Sir Isaac Newton, known for his disciplined approach to mathematics; and many others. They became the guiding stars illuminating human civilization, and I aspire to become one of those stars.

The current focus of scientific development lies in AI. Therefore, in order to shine among them, I must focus on the present moment. Currently, I am studying Data Science, which is a multidisciplinary field closely related to AI. Although I aspire to become a polymath, I understand the importance of staying committed to what I am currently learning.</p>
